Software: Alloy 6 (from the Alloy website: http://alloytools.org/)

Description: Using Alloy to diagnose and investigate a fix for a recent vulnerability in the the popular Secure Shell (ssh) protocol. This protocol allows a client to connect to a server
and to execute shell commands on the server and observe their output. The protocol provides security, including authenticating the server to the client (so the client knows they are talking to the intended server) and protecting the client/server communication by encrypting it, preventing adversaries from being able to observe and tamper with the shell commands/responses sent
between the client and server.
